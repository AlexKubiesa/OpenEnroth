Might and Magic VI-VIII engine remake using original data & code

# Getting Started
1. Create an env variable named WoMM_MM7_INSTALL_DIR that will point to your mm7 installation directory (GoG or older releases).
2. Use one of the projects for Visual Studio in /Builds folder. Latest are most up-to-date.
3. Download latest libavcodec binaries and place them in your mm7 installation folder. Required DLLs:
  * avcodec-55.dll
  * avformat-55.dll
  * avutil-52.dll
  * swresample-0.dll
  * swscale-2.dll
4. On older releases you will probably also need fixed MSS32.dll.
5. Compile & run.
