Might and Magic VI-VIII engine remake using original data & code

# Getting Started
1. Use one of the projects for Visual Studio in /Builds folder. Latest are most up-to-date.
2. Required libavcodec dependencies are located in required_dlls folder
3. On older releases you will probably also need fixed MSS32.dll if project crashes for you.
4. Compile & run.
5. Launcher will try to guess your game installation directory (GoG or older releases). You can override folder with game resources using GUI.
